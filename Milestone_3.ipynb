Frist of all, we see that some product name as extreme long name so it reduces the readibility for our app. With them, we will keep only the begining of the name before that a common string is detected ([même code...]). For our app again, we decide to add brands. Finally to improve the speed of our algorithm to detect healthier product than the one selected by the users, we compute the grade and the NutriScore for each product of the database."
